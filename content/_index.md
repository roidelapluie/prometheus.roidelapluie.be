[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a monitoring tool hosted by the
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/). It takes different approaches than other
monitoring tools, as it is entirely based on *metrics*. This small website is
published to share my own experience and document several patterns and tools I
have tried, have used or might use.
